## January 14 - 27
- Created MakeAtmGrid.py which interpolates rotated LiveOcean data (pressure, uwind, vwind to square grid for 12km resolution
	- Had few iterations due to creating MET forcing file starting from lower left corner (just like LiveOcean), rather than a normal grid (starting from upper left corner like how DFM reads it even though it specifies the starting LLC coordinate
- Ran DFM (TwinHarbors_test05) with just MET data and results aren't too off (<O(1))
- Running DFM model with MET data and tides only to look at results (TwinHarbors_test06)
