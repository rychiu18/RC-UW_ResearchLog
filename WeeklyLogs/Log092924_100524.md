## Summary:
1) DFM model (v4) with no weir simulated magnitude of elevated water levels, but had a damped signal 
2) DFM model (v5.5) with weir simulated magnitude of elevated water levels better, but still had damped signal for initial period of storm (better than v4 no weir)
3) Sections upstream of Montesano are left dry the entire model run (seen in both model runs with AND without fixed weir)

## To do:
1) Run DFM model (v4) with NO weir
2) Run DFM model (v5.5) WITH weir 
3) Check along channel discharge for leaks (with weir runs)

## Results:
### 1) DFM model (v4) no weir
- Simulated water levels at Montesano are much better (no overestimated signal like the run with the fixed weir)
- Comparisons between the v4 grid WITH the fixed weir (Fig. 1) and WITHOUT the fixed weir (Fig. 2)
- Water levels lowered due to water spilling over to the floodplain instead of confined within the channel previously due to the fixed weir
- Water levels are still significantly damped

### 2) DFM model (v5.5) with weir
- Downstream: 12m
- Upstream: 2m
- Simulated water levels do better than v5.1 and v5.4 (upstream 15m, downstream 2m)
- HOWEVER, it will be difficult to justify the addition of the fixed weir in our model
- Comparisons between the v5.5 grid WITH the fixed weir (Fig. 3) and WITHOUT the fixed weir (Fig. 4)
