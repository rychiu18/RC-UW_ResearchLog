# May 19 - May 25, 2024

## Summary:
1) Created new workflow for DFM model runs <br>
2) Running Stantec's Twin Harbors model with new SWAN grid <br>

## Tasks:
1) Write new .slurm scripts to run DFM model, merge, then export variable files. <br>
2) Integrate new SWAN grid into DFM model

## Results:
### 1) Create workflow for running, merging, and extracting DFM model outputs
- Altered test.slurm and submit_singulariy.sh files to 1) call run_dfmoutput.sh to merge map files, and 2) call writeDFMVars.py to extract targed variable files (default vars: time, ssh, waterdepth, ucx, ucy, ucmag, hwav, twav) 
- New files can be found in 'mmfs1/gscratch/derakhti/shared/rchiu18/masterfiles/'

### 2) Integrate new SWAN grid into DFM model
Created new grid (.grd) and bathymetry (.dep) files and forced DFM model with new OOI buoy data (western edge, northern edge). Changed .mdw and .bcw files in waves folder to include new BCs and forcing with JONSWAP spectra along both boundaries.
*Note to self: .dep file dimensions must be [m+1:n+1]

## Issues:
- Model runs are extremely slow: ~1 day to model ~2 days in our domain.
- DFM output shows constant wave period and wave height at each location for entire model run.

## Next Steps:
- Compare wave spectra from model at Grays Harbor CDIP buoy location and observed data at buoy (if possible).
- Refine bathymetry grid for SWAN
