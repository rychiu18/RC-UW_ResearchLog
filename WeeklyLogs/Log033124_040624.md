# March 24 - March 30
## Summary:
1) Changing coordinates to match Stantec's in their report yields much better agreement between the model output and NOAA tide gauges (Tokepoint and Westport) referenced to MSL.
  - Coordinate for Statenc's Tokepoint coordinate is ~400m SE of NOAA gauge.
  - Coordinate for Stantec's Westport coordinate is ~1,350m SE of NOAA gauge.
  - Westport SSH is still truncated at LLW.

## Tasks:
1) Match location with NOAA_WL_OBS.xyn file for Tokepoint and Westport stations

## Results
1) Compare DFM model output's water levels at Stantec's station coordinates
  - Used Tokepoint and Westport coordinates found in Stantec's report, and plotted 1999 and 2023 water levels at cell closest and had much better results
  - Plotted SSH with newly downloaded NOAA water level (MSL)
