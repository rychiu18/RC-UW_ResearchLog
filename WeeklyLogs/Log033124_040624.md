# March 24 - March 30
## Summary:


## Tasks:
1) Match location with NOAA_WL_OBS.xyn file for Tokepoint and Westport stations

'''
'''
1) Compare DFM model output's water levels at Stantec's station coordinates
  - Used Tokepoint and Westport coordinates found in Stantec's report, and plotted 1999 and 2023 water levels at cell closest and had much better results
  - Plotted SSH with newly downloaded NOAA water level (MSL)
