# October 13 - 19, 2024

## Summary:
1) Ran DFM model (v4) with discharge output for Chehalis River channel<br>
2) Plotted cross sectional area, discharge, and water levels<br>

## To do:
1) Create new transect points for main channel and add observation points for cross section<br>


## Results:
# 1) Discharge for main channel
