# August 11 - August 17, 2024

## Summary:
1) Run DFM model for tides, tides+MET, tides+MET+discharge<br>
2) Plot map with wetting/drying thresholdbr>
3) Work on analytical modelbr>

## To do:
1) Run DFM models to get different scenarios (tides, tides+MET, tides+MET+discharge, tides+MET+discharge+waves)br>
2) Re-plot DFM output map with thresholds for floodingbr>
3) Work on analytical model for Grays Harborbr>

## Results:
### 1) DFM model runs
- Ran DFM model with tides - Model T(Job19870441) (Fig. 1)
- Ran DFM model with tides+MET - Model TM (Job19878243) (Fig. 1)
- Ran DFM model with tides+MET+discharge - Model TMD (Job19883575) (Fig. 1)
- Ran DFM model with tides+MET+discharge+waves - Model TMDW (Job19687905) (Fig. 1)

Figure 1: Water levels along Grays Harbor transect for all 4 models.<br>

- Models T and TM had mostly same water levels (<5 cm difference for all transect sites) (Fig. 2)
- Models TMD and TMDW had mostly same water levels (<9cm) (Fig. 3)
- Testing the T+M model again, but it seems like discharge may make the largest difference in terms of water level influence during storm events

### 2) Re-plot flood map
Re-plot flooding map for Grays Harbor using 0.01m threshold (Fig. 4).<br>

### 3) Analytical model
- Fit line to Chehalis River width convergence (Fig. 5)<br>
- Solved initial water level for transect (Fig. 6)<br>

## Next steps:
- Figure out how to create restart files from *merged_map.nc files for specific time
- Figure out how to plot triangular mesh grid on Python efficiently
- Continue analytical model
