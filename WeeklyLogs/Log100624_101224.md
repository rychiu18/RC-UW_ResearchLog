# October 06 - 12, 2024

## Summary:
1) Generated cross sections along Chehalis River based on max inundation observed for the December 2023 storm<br>
2) Plotted cross sectional area, discharge, and water levels<br> 


## To do:
1) Run model (TMD) with v4 grid including new observation and discharge points
2) Cross-section profiles
3) Along-channel profiles
4) Team 2 meeting presentation 


## Results:
1) Cross sections for Chehalis River<br>
- Ran model TMD w/v4 grid (no weir)
- Chose transect points (13) based on max inundation (spaced ~4km apart) (Fig. 1)

2) Plotted cross sectional area, discharge, and water levels<br>
- Generated cross section file (CrsFile) for model to generate cross sectional area and discharge
- Plotted cross sectional area for each transect (Fig. 2)
- Plotted discharge for each transect (Fig. 3)
- Plotted cumulative discharge for each transect (Fig. 4)
- Plotted cross channel water depth profile for each transect (Fig. 5-17)

### Team 2 meeting presentation
- Background + motivation
- Model grid/development
- Flood map/animation
- Thoughts on what to include as products
	- % inundated relative to MHW
	- shapefiles
	- 

## Issues:
- Transects at certain points (9, 11) are dry until storm arrival (Dec. 05)


## To do:
