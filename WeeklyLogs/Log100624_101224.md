# October 06 - 12, 2024

## Summary:
1) Generated cross sections along Chehalis River based on max inundation observed for the December 2023 storm<br>
2) Plotted cross sectional area, discharge, and water levels<br> 


## To do:
1) Run model (TMD) with v4 grid including new observation and discharge points<br>
2) Cross-section profiles<br>
3) Team 2 meeting presentation ideas<br>


## Results:
### 1) Cross sections for Chehalis River<br>
- Ran model TMD w/v4 grid (no weir)
- Chose transect points (13) based on max inundation (spaced ~4km apart) (Fig. 1)

### 2) Plotted cross sectional area, discharge, and water levels<br>
- Generated cross section file (CrsFile) for model to generate cross sectional area and discharge
- Plotted cross sectional area for each transect (Fig. 2)
- Plotted discharge for each transect (Fig. 3)
- Plotted cumulative discharge for each transect (Fig. 4)
- Plotted cross channel water depth profile for each transect (Fig. 5-17)
	- Transects 4 and 5 are supposed to be in tidal surge plain but much of it seems very dry/shallow (which could make sense, plots make it difficult to see shallow depths)
	- Transect 7 (just downstream of Montesano) gets pretty deep in channel during large discharge)
	- Transect 8 is the last point where we can see "some" tidal influence
	- Transects 9 and 11 show dry until December 5, which is seen in animation
	- Transect 9 shows two water channels (north channel could be caused by lakes/pools/streams that are seen in Google maps (but relatively shallow (<2m)
	- Transect 10 show very deep channel (up to 10m), which could explain where the discharge from Satsop pools up
	- Transect 11 shows two water channels, similar to 9 where north channel has existing pools and streams
	- Discharge at Porter cross section shows values agree with USGS gauge

### Team 2 meeting presentation
- Background + motivation
- Model grid/development
- Flood map/animation
- Discussion on what planners, scientists, communities can use the output for?
	- % inundated relative to MHW
	- shapefiles


## Issues:
- Transects at certain points (9, 11) are dry until storm arrival (Dec. 05)


## To do:
- Run model with different grid version and compare cross channel profiles, discharge, and along-channel profile
- Put cross sections along Wynoochee and Satsop
- Improve cross-sectional water depth plots (make x_dist real, improve resolution of colorbar to see shallower depths)
- Start presentation for Team 2 meeting
- Brainstorm more ideas for Winter Storms Forum
