# January 28 - February 03, 2024
- Still working on fixing DFM model with met data and tides
	- Weird psychedelic plots were result of assigning fixed indices for plotting for each *_map.nc file and starting the model run at 111523 instead of referenced to beginning of month
	- BUT still seeing sharp increases in water level/SSH after fixing
	- MET and pressure field looks good though
 - Tried Yingzhong's setup for new test.slurm and submit_singularity.sh scripts but did NOT work, so reverted to using old cpu/node configuration
