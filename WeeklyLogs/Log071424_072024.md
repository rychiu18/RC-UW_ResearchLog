# July 14 - July 20, 2024

## Summary:
1) Finish and submit CoPes proposal
2) Run DFM with new grid (again)
3) Start making analytical model for Twin Harbors

## To do:
1) Submit CoPes proposal
2) Rerun DFM with new grid and fixed northern boundary points
3) Read literature/write down equations for analytical model

## Results:
1) DFM model
- Reran DFM model with adjusted northern boundary points and increased processors (108).
	- Original oc_north.pli file included transect from offshore to shoreline. New points designated eastern coordinate to be more offshore and not in high-resolution coastal grid cells.
- Ran with tides and MET and worked fine (~7 hours)
- Ran with tides, MET, and Q and worked fine (~9 hours)
- Ran with tides, MET, Q, and waves and running fine (so far)
	- Run time slower after getting to 12-02-2023; taking 4 hours of run time to model ~4 hours)
	- Initially, model simulated 7 days within 1 day of run time
- Ran into nNetElemMaxNode error (=5 but expected 3 or 4)
	- Issue fixed, new grid had one point with 5 nodes, but Yingzhong removed for new grid 'final_mesh_net_new.nc'
