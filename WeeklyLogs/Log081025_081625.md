## Summary:
* Balance is largely between gravity and pressure forces
* Tried different interpolating approaches to force balance calculations
* Most terms were relatively unchanged, except for gravity term and pressure forces
* V2, V3, and V4 refer to tabs in summary document:

## Results:
* Comparisons between 3 interpolation methods:
1) 5m x 5m (rectangular) - v2 (Fig. 1)
2) 20m x 20m (rectangular) - v3 (Fig. 2)
3) Varying (unstructured, original) - v4 (Fig. 3)

* Interpolated mesh grids for water depth on 11-27-2023T03:20:00

* All terms plotted against each other
	- Term that changes the most is Fg (gravity term)

* Gravity term calculations
	- Largest change in v4 is the estimation of slope
	- This results in an overestimation as I use the bed slope of the thalweg

* Takeaways:
	- Hi
* Most terms are relatively the same EXCEPT for the gravity term!
* Using isolated interpolated t49 cross-section brings area lower.
* Unsteady term doesn't change much
* Friction term doesn't change much
* Flux term is straight from cross-section output
* Pressure term could be wrong due to different area calculated for GH_T49
* Gravity term doesn't change much
