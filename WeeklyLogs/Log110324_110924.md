## Summary:
1) Analytical model

## Results:
### 1) Varying depth (for Lb = 8100)
- Mouth and head water levels for varying depths (5m, 10m, 15m, 20m, 30m) - Fig. 1

Figure 1: Eta at the mouth and head for different depths.


- Parameters (wavenumber/wavelength, friction coefficient, damping coefficient, and phase lead) for varying depths - Figs. 2
	- Wavelength for most depths are on the order of 100-400km, except for 15m (extremely large, 10^3)
	-

- Looked at eta and u for varying depths (5m, 10m, 15m, 20m, 30m) - Lb = 8100 (optimized width scale)
	- Eta starts very damped at 5m and becomes amplified at 15, 30, and 50m
	- Eta is weirdly damped at 20m
	- Eta is flatter for H=15 than other depths
- Wavelength for all depths are on the order of 100-400,000, except for 15m (extremely large, 10^6)
- Phase lag observed for signal at the head, but varies depending on depth




## 2) Varying width convergence
- Changing L_b to 

## Issues:
- Phase shift issue (especially at H=15m)
- Wavenumber/wavelength issue (especially at H=15m)
- Inflection point somewhere between 10m, 15m, and 20m


## Next Steps:
- Compare parameter values with other literature
