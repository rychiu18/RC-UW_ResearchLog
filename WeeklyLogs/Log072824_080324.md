# July 28 - August 03, 2024

## Summary:
1) Run DFM with new grid (again)
2) Decompose Westport water level
3) DFM restart file

## To do:
1) Complete run for DFM with new grid
2) Decompose Westport water levels and draft up analysis
3) Research into DFM restart file for model run

## Results
### 1) DFM model
- Began run on 

### 2) Decompose Westport water levels
- https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H_t6GQVyG6VNaXZm33C56PRieUtmSzSBsrdhyDpZ2S4/edit
- 

### 3) DFM restart file
- Using output from Job18090231 to test RestartFile configuration (TwinHarbors_test13)
	- Run only had tides for November 8 - 27
	- Testing restart from November 20 (1641600)
	- Files contained in TwinHarbors_test16
- Received error message when trying to run with FlowFM_merged_map.nc file
	>> ** ERROR  : The specified restart file is of UGRID format, which is not supported.
	- Perhaps due to MapFormat = 4 (4: netCDF UGRID), instead of 1: netCDF
	- Will need to run TwinHarbors_test13 again and turn on Rst file output and set RstInterval 


## Next steps
- Decompose Westport water levels
	- Filter out frequency bands from tides
- Create a rough analytical model (implicit) of Grays Harbor based on Van Rijn (2011)
