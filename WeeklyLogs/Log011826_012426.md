## Summary+takeaways:
1) December 2015 analysis (Grays Harbor)
* D8 tidal band is largest contributor to nonlinear interaction signal at Montesano
* Same wavelet analysis done on upstream and downstream locations found minimal contribution from overtides 


## Results:
### 1) December 2015 analysis (Grays Harbor)
* Expanded analysis:
	* https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qJ-AD4PZNuqJLrgbc75YmX5wcYAvHjA1AhB6RHt6cMU/edit?tab=t.0
* Still unsure about how to interpret results as literature commonly finds M4 to be the dominant overtide contributor 


## Next steps:
* Read up on wavelet analysis interpretation
* Work on NCH poster
