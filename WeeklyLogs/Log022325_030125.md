## Summary
1) Wrapping up remote sensing work

## Results
### a) Redid map showing overlapping and individual wet cells
- Inundation map shows:
	- Overlapping wet cells
	- Wet image cells (dry MSL cells)
	- Wet MSL cells (dry image cells)
- Showing spatial variability:
	- Lowest tide for record (12/02/2024) (Fig. 1)
		- Covers 93% of the MSL cells
	- Highest tide for record (12/24/2024) Fig. 2)
		- Covers 98% of the MSL cells
	- Time near MSL (~-0.012m) but with high NTR (0.32m)
		- Overlaps same % as low tide image
		- Inundation higher in lower half of Grays Harbor

### b) Relationship between wetted surface area and Westport water levels
- Medium correlation between water levels at Westport and image wetted surface area (Fig. 4)
- "Stronger" correlation between water levels at Westport and images with small residuals (NTR<0.1m) (Fig. 5, 6)
- Instances where wetted area exceeded MSL wetted area only occur when Westport water levels exceed MSL (Fig. 7)

### c) Distribution of wetted area
- Distribution of all wetted surface area images is left skewed while filtered wetted surface area images (NTR<0.1m) is left skewed but more Gaussian (Fig. 8)
	- Images with larger NTR add more surface area to system, explaining the stronger left skew

### d) Planning for future remote sensing image availability
- Frequency for radar images are every 1d 11:48hr, 6d 23:41hr, and 3d 12:19hr
- 2024 data record (Fig. 9):
	- 13/26 (50%) images occur when Westport water levels are below MSL (1.141m)
	- 25/26 (96%) images occur when Westport water levels are below MHW (2.218m)
	- 7/26 (27%) images occur when Westport water levels are below MLW (0.083m)
- 2025 (Jan-June) data record (Fig. 10):
	- 26/45 ((57%) images occur when Westport water levels are below MSL (1.141m)
	- 44/45 (97%) images occur when Westport water levels are below MHW (2.218m)
	- 10/45 (22%) images occur when Westport water levels are below MLW (0.083m)
- 2025 (Jan-Dec) data record (Fig. 11):
	- 52/92 (56%) images occur when Westport water levels are below MSL (1.141m)
	- 89/92 (96%) images occur when Westport water levels are below MHW (2.218m)
	- 19/92 (20%) images occur when Westport water levels are below MLW (0.083m)
- Future questions with more images:
	- Distribution of spatial inundation frequency
	- Stronger relationship between Westport water level and total wetted surface area
	- Confirmation that total wetted surface area exceeds MSL wetted surface area every time MSL is exceeded at Westport
	- Smaller NTR during non-stormy periods to get more MSL images
		- How wetted surface area may change without influence of high river discharge
