# January 07 - January 13, 2024
- Ran new DFM model with only tides (previous run had tide forcings removed, but added back in)
- Created MakeDischarge.py script to take USGS discharge and output new file to make readable for DFM
- Created MakeAtmGrid.py to try to merge and isolate wind and pressure data from LiveOcean
- Created TwinHarbors_05 to run ONLY atmospheric data for testing
