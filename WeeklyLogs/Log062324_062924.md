### 2) Read papers<br>
<strong>Dynamic Modeling of Coastal Compound Flooding Hazards Due to Tides, Extratropical Storms, Waves, and Sea-Level Rise: A Case Study in the Salish Sea, Washington (USA) (Nederhoff et al., 2024)</strong>
- Used PS-CoSMoS to compare results between SFINCS and XBeach-NH+ for Whatcom County during 2018 storm
- Tested flooding extent between two models for different SLR scenarios
Used a wave transformation lookup table (LUT) of Beach transect runs to prescribe incoming wave energy along the SFINCS domain to allow hundreds of storm events for different SLR scenarios to be run
- SFINCS-based workflow reproduced the main patterns observed during 2018 storm event in Birch Bay
- Differences (underestimation) due to reduced modeling complexity of SFINCS)
- Flood exposure expected to increase substantially w/SLR as TWL increases nonlinearly
	- Flood extent projected to increase by 5-13% from current level to a future 1m SLR


On the momentum balance of Tampa Bay (Chen et al., 2019)
- Used FVCOM and adcp measurements to look at momentum balance in Tampa Bay
- Complex geometries and freshwater input force momentum balance terms to adjust to close equation
- Averaging over 91 days:
	- Near surface balance was between advective acceleration, PGF and friction (in that oder)
		- Advective acceleration due to complex geometry and relatively small friction
		- Fresh water inputs alter PGF
	- Near bottom balance was between PGF, friction, and advective acceleration
		- Advective acceleration takes less of a role bc of increased friction near bottom


## Issues:

## Next steps:
- Start creating momentum budget for Willapa Bay and Grays Harbor
- Run new DFM model?
