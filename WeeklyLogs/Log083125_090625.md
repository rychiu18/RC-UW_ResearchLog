## Summary:
* Compared mass balance between original GH_T60.5/GH_T61 transect and an expanded GH_T60.5/GH_T61 control volume (CV)
	* Large sum of mass unaccounted for in the original CV
	* Expanded CV shows a closed mass budget, telling us that CV for the force balance approach should be expanded
* Summary of mass balance analysis

## Takeaways:
* Mass budget is sensitive to CV size and expanding GH_T60.5/GH_T61 transect to include agricultural fields closes the budget
* This may translate to error we see in the force balance approach due to the approach not accounting for flooding beyond the smaller CV


## Next steps:
* Test new CV with force balance approach to see if it closes the budget
