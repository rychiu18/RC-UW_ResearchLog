##November 12 - November 18, 2023
- Ran DFM model (Job ID: 15392871) on 11/17.
  - Changed time in "dimr_config_parallel.xml" from "<time>0 3600 2592000</time>" to "<time>0 3600 86400</time>" (should be 24 hours).
  - Changed time in "dimr_config_parallel_lib.xml" from "<time>0 3600 2592000</time>" to "<time>0 3600 86400</time>" (should be 24 hours).
  - Job timed out, time domain for model still too long/unchanged.
  - Need to change FlowFM.mdu file and FlowFM_month.mdu file (maybe?).
- Ran DFM model (Job ID: 15387075) on 11/16.
  - Altered model runtime on test.slurm script to 10 minutes (works, but doesn't exit out cleanly, dates for model run still not changed).
- Met with Christie to talk about research questions for DFM model (11/17/23).
  - Look at WB or GB and start with comparison for water levels first.
  - Can later on look at influence of atmospheric forcing (resolution very large), and riverine influence.
