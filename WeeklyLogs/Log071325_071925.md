## Summary:
* Ran model with cross-sections and cross-channel observation points to calculate force balance equation for control volume (between two cross-sections along Chehalis River)
	* Was able to get residuals oscillating around 0, but still of same order of magnitude as individual terms
	* Using P_avg, bed stress term is one order of magnitude smaller than all the other terms (O(6) vs O(7))
	* Time varying term seems to have largest influence
	* Have suspicion that bed stress should be much greater


## Results:
### Force balance
- Included cross section output for GH_T49/GH_T50 (mostly east-west transect; just downstream of Montesano gauge)
	- Cross sectionally averaged area and discharge (gives cross-sectionally averaged velocity)
- New cross-channel observation points gives individual bed stress and water levels
