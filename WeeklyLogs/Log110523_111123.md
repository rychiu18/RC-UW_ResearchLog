## November 05 - November 11
Research Ideas:
- Lateral circulation at mouth of Willapa River and Chehalis River (affects H101 and H105)
  - Motivation: Observe/model momentum budget at bends at mouth to look at bank erosion or salt transport
    - Compare between WB and GH
  - Would require instruments put out and bathymetry survey
    - NCEI has 1/3 arc second (10m) resolution DEM for Willapa Bay (stops just west of Raymond)
    - GH: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/grays-harbor-p280-bathymetric-digital-elevation-model-noaa-nos-estuarine-bathymetry
	- Updated 11/12/2020 (1/3 arc second)
  - How does ebb/flood tides for stratified/unstratified flows affect the energy at the bends?
    - Is it asymmetrical or symmetrical? (Primary, secondary flows that can affect erosion)

- Model vertical structure at mouth of rivers during storm events (compared to normal ebb/flood tides)
- Look at time lag between Tokepoint station and Willapa River gauge (east of Raymond)
