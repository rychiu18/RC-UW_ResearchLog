## March 24 - March 30
- Look at Stantec model datum and compare with new model
	- In Stantec report, Toke point and Westport are referenced to MLLW
	- Westport NAVD88 = +1.12 ft
		- Mean ∆SSH in full DFM model is ~1.32m
    		- https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/datums.html?id=9441102
	- Toke point NAVD88 = +0.82 ft
   		- Mean ∆SSH in full DFM model is ~1.38 m
- Depth at points nearest to observation points based on bathymetry file (*tw_v60m*)
	- Westport: -5.8507181825396275m
	- Montesano: -5.0m
	- Toke point: -1.4809497578709583
 - Ran DFM model (TwinHarbors_test11) with no forcing
	- Westport: SSH=0, waterdepth = 6.12327292m
	- Toke point: SSH=0, waterdepth = 1.42673181m
	- Montesano: SSH=0, waterdepth = 5m
 - Ran original model from Stantec to look at results at each observation station
 - Ran TwinHarbors_test10 with tides, merged discharge (Satsop+Porter), waves (no MET)

Issues:
- Disk quota exceeded for model runs due to >200GB
	- Fixed by:
		- Deleting older files and running one model at a time
		- Created extract_netcdf.sh script to create new files with specific variables, decreasing the size of each output file by >50%
