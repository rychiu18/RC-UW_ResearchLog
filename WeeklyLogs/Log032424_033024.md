## March 24 - March 30
Tasks
1) Look at Stantec model datum and compare with new model
2) Ran DFM model (TwinHarbors_test11) with no forcing
3) Ran original model from Stantec to look at results at each observation station
4) Ran TwinHarbors_test10 with tides, merged discharge (Satsop+Porter), waves (no MET)
5) Ran TwinHarbors_test12 with tides, waves (no MET)

1) Comparison of Stantec model and DFM model (2023):
- Stantec report shows Toke point and Westport stations are referenced to MLLW
	- Stantec report (1999):
		- Westport NAVD88 is +1.77 ft (above MLLW)
		- Tokepoint NAVD88 is +0.82 ft (above MLLW)
		- Aberdeen NAVD88 is +1.64 ft (above MLLW)
	- According to NOAA (2023):
		- Westport NAVD88 is +1.12 ft (above MLLW)
			- Mean ∆SSH in full DFM model (T+M+D+W) is ~1.32m
    			- https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/datums.html?id=9441102
		- Toke point is +0.82 ft (above MLLW)
   			- Mean ∆SSH in full DFM model is ~1.38 m

2) Ran DFM model (2023) with no forcing (TwinHarbors_test11):
	- Westport: SSH=0, waterdepth = 6.12327292m
	- Toke point: SSH=0, waterdepth = 1.42673181m
	- Montesano: SSH=0, waterdepth = 5m

3) 1999 Stantec model run:
	- Could only compare Tokepoint station (no GH or Westport stations in 1999 in Stantec folder)
	- Water depth output exceeded NOAA observations (NAVD88)
	- SSH output underestimated NOAA observations (NAVD88)
	- SSH (+0.24m) output brings us closer to NOAA observations but still underestimated
		- Added 0.24m assuming that model output is in MLLW (Stantec Report), so +0.24m is correction to NAVD88 based on Tokepoint NOAA station

4) Ran DFM (2023) model (T+D*+W) (TwinHarbors_test10)
	- Tides, discharge (merged), and waves
	- Tokepoint:
		- Water depth output aligned with observations (NAVD88)
		- SSH output underestimated NOAA observations (NAVD88)
		- SSH (+0.24m) output brings us closer, but still underestimated
	- Westport:
		- Water depth output way overestimated observations
  - (Maybe plot again?) 
- # Insert pictures here from Job17433700 run

5) Ran DFM (2023) model (T+W) (TwinHarbors_test12)
	- Tides and waves only
	- Tokepoint:
		- Water depth output aligned with obserations (NAVD88)
		- SSH output underestimated NOAA observations (NAVD88)
		- SSH (+0.24m) output brings us closer, but still underestimated
	- Westport:
		- Water depth output overestimated observations (NAVD88) by a lot (>4m)
		- SSH output underestimated NOAA observations (NAVD88)
		- SSH (+0.34m) output brings us closer, but still underestimated

- Depth at points nearest to observation points based on bathymetry file (*tw_v60m*)
	- Westport: -5.8507181825396275m
	- Montesano: -5.0m
	- Toke point: -1.4809497578709583

Issues:
- Disk quota exceeded for model runs due to >200GB
	- Tried to fix by:
		- Deleting older files and running one model at a time
		- Created extract_netcdf.sh script to create new files with specific variables, decreasing the size of each output file by >50%
	- Issue NOT resolved
- Cannot use nctoolkit in environment because it requires python version 3.8+ (environment uses v=3.6)
