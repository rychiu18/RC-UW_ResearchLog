## December 10 - December 16
- Laid out OSM poster roadmap
	- Run different models (tides, tides+Q, tides+SS, tides+Q+SS) for December storm event
- Ran 1999 model with just tides (or tried to) - TwinHarbors_test02
- Think about different reanalysis products for wind and atm. pressure forcing for atmospheric forcing in the model with higher resolution than CFSR (Stantec uses) which is ~38km
- Registered for OSM 2024
