# July 27 - August 02, 2025

## Summary:
* Made adjustments to code and equations to use more output from merged_map file instead of relying on observation points/cross-sections
	* https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg0rbluJZ7KoBvSvie-XAdYaMI1DoPUDk0VO89neMEI/edit?usp=sharing
* Spent most of time this week coding it up, so didn't do much analysis since I need to do more checks on the code/equations
* Interpolated control volume to rectangular grid and calculated based on individual cells within control volume to get more accurate calculations 
	* Summing up calculations instead of using averages (tau_avg, H_avg)
* Relative to last week's calculations:
	* Time varying term roughly same order of magnitude
	* Friction term two orders of magnitude smaller
	* Pressure terms roughly same order of magnitude
	* Advection terms roughly an order of magnitude larger


## To do:
* Need to go over previous calculations
* Plot individual variables to verify accurate of each term
