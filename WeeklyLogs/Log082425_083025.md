## Summary:
* Calculated balances for GH_T34/GH_T35, GH_T49/GH_T50, GH_T60/GH_T61, GH_T60.5/GH_T61, and GH_T61/GH_T62
* Balance is largely between gravity and pressure forces (except for fully tidal transects - GH_T34/GH_T35)
* Able to get balance near 0 for GH_T60.5/GH_T61 and GH_T61/GH_T62 transects prior to December 03
	* Gravity term becomes extremely large afterwards due to overbank flooding not captured within the control volume calculations
* Summary of each CV analysis

## Takeaways:
* Budget is more sensitive after flooding occurs upstream 
	* CV doesn't (accurately) capture overbank flows, leading to a massive pressure term as the entire pressure gradient cannot be accounted for
* For downstream sections, all terms are on the same order of magnitude (e.g., GH_T34/GH_T35)
	* With the exception of the gravity term
* Gravity term is sensitive to CV as inundated areas can include cells with small water depth but large slopes


## Next steps:
* Expand CV to include flooded areas
* Filter out cells with small water depths (<0.5m)?
