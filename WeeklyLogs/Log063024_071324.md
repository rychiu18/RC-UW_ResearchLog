# June 30 - July 13, 2024

## Summary:
1) Ran DFM with new grid<br>
2) CoPes pilot proposal<br>

## To do:
1) Run new DFM model with new grid and .mdu file adjustments<br>
2) 2nd draft of CoPes pilot project proposal<br>
3) Start code for momentum budget of Twin Harbor estuary along-channel transects<br>

## Results:
### 1) Run DFM model with new grid
- Run only reached Nov. 25 2300 (2 days and 23 hours) from 20 hours of model run time
- Winds looked normal
- Some instabilities along Vancouver Island and Strait of Juan De Fuca early on (Figure 1)
	- Thought that straight was ignored in model?
	- Columbia River also has no water
- Water levels, water depth, velocity magnitude, bottom stress, discharge magnitude explode:
	- CDIP036 explodes at ~Nov 25, 2110
	- TIDE-5-MON (Montesano) explodes at ~Nov 25, 2220

## Issues:
- Water levels explodes with new grid


## Next steps:
- Currently running DFM model with no discharge
- Finish CoPes proposal
- Investigate why water levels explode
- Filter out sections where instabilities occur on map
