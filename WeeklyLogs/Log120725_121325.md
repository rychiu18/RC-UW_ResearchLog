## Summary+takeaways:
1) Jan2015 storm analysis<br>
* To accurately model the entire Grays Harbor system including the Chehalis River, we need tides, discharge, and MET (TMD) to accurately model upstream and the mouth of the bay<br>
2) Dec2025 storm forecast<br>
* Able to predict water levels at Westport, Tokepoint but Montesano water levels could be affected by inaccurate predicted river discharge used for the model; WR01 and WR02 did reasonably well<br>
3) Dec2007 MET reanalysis<br>
* Found ERA5 reanalysis dataset but super coarse relative to our usual 4km resolution WRF data


## Results:
### 1) Jan2015 storm analysis
* Ran T, D, TD, TM, and TMD model runs
* To accurately model the entire Grays Harbor system including the Chehalis River, we need tides, discharge, and MET
* Water level comparisons between different models (T, TD, TM, TMD) tell us that:
	* MET makes the largest difference in accurately predicting water levels at the Westport tide gauge (Fig. 1)
	* Adding in MET along with discharge gives us a more accurate prediction for water levels at the upstream Montesano station with (Fig. 2)

### 2) Dec2025 forecast model runs
* Modeled Dec. 03-11, 2025 (forecasting starting from 11/07/25 22:00)
* Did not complete TMDW model run
	* Did not complete due to HYAK maintenance
	* With 4 nodes, 36 tasks per node, and 1,400G of memory, estimated to take ~3 days to run
* Completed TMD model run (Fig. 3)
	* Model did well near entrance of Grays Harbor and Willapa Bay
	* Montesano forecasted water level did not dampen and increase as much as observed
	* Water levels at WR01 and WR02 show a shift in phase during falling tides, but agree well during the forecasted period
	* Predicted and observed discharge rates differ tremendously, which could have drastically affected the upstream water level response for Montesano (Fig. 4)

### 3) Dec2007 reanalysis
* Using ECMWF ERA5 renanalysis hourly dataset to recreate MET forcing for Dec2007 storm (Fig. 5)
	* https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=download
	* Most accessible and downloadable dataset I could find
	* Resolution pretty coarse though (27.8 by 19.2 km)
	* Need to compare pressure measured at Westport as sanity check

## Next steps:
* More thorough analysis of December 2015 storm
	* Create along channel/spatial difference map showing discharge and MET contributions
	* Recreate Fig. 5,6, and 8 from Bao et al. (2024) showing:
		* Spatial maps of compound flood peak, max compound effect contribution, nonlinear effect contribution
		* Temporal and spatial evolution of the channel under different processes
* Finish interpolating Dec. 2007 MET data and run model
* Run Dec.2025 storm with observed data (discharge and MET forcing) to see if it is more accurate than our predicted forecast
