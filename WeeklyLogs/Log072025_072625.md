## Summary:
* In-depth analysis of force balance (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg0rbluJZ7KoBvSvie-XAdYaMI1DoPUDk0VO89neMEI/edit?usp=sharing)
* Calculated gravity term but residual is still roughly an order of magnitude larger than all the other terms
* Either pressure term needs to be an order of magnitude smaller, or friction term needs to be an order of magnitude larger to balance out

## To do:
* Try calculating for downstream section with less influence of compound flooding
