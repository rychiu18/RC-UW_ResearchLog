- Email with Julie Heilman (WSDOT) about potentially getting water mark surveys in Grays Harbor County and Pacific County
- Added more to DFM analysis code
  - Wave height, period, water level, wind speed, water velocity, air pressure
  - Plotted river outflow transect data for Willapa River and it seems to match average flow data from USGS gage
