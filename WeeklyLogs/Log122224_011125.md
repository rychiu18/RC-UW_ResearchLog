## Summary
1) Trying to reproduce spreadsheet model from van Rijn

## Results
- van Rijn sent over spreadsheet model
- Things that were different:
	- Calculations for Chezy's and hydraulic radius
		- In van Rijn (2011), C=65 for ks=0.03
		- Using spreadsheet model equations, C=64.83 for ks=0.03 
	- Included river discharge (but set to 0)
- Biggest difference was using the initial peak velocity:
	- "Remember, the model is linearized. Basically, the roughness depends on the velocity. So, you have to iterate (trial and error) manually a few times by making an input velocity equal to the computed velocity."
	- Set U_max (characteristic peak velocity) to 0.67 to calculate friction and other terms
	- Calculated peak velocity that is then used to calculate along channel velocity for each time step
- Tidal amplitude is also calculated first, then used to calculate along channel water level for each time step

Steps I've gathered from the spreadsheet:<br>
1) Calculate beta<br>
2) Calculate omega<br>
3) Calculate hydraulic radius (R)<br>
4) Calculate Chezy's (C)<br>
5) Calculate linearized friction coefficient (m)<br>
6) Calculate classical wave speed (co)<br>
7) Calculate alpha and wavenumber (k) based on "amplified" or "dampened" regime<br>
8) Calculate friction coefficient (mu)<br>
9) Calculate wave speed (c)<br>
10) Calculate phase speed (phi)<br>
11) Calculate width (b)

Next are the new steps:<br>
12) Calculate tidal amplitude (along channel)<br>
13) Calculate peak velocity (along channel)<br>
14) Calculate water level at each time step based on location<br>
15) Calculate velocity at each time step based on location (using peak velocity calculated, but unsure how he got 0.824)

## Issues
- Close to reproducing but unsure about finding peak velocity at each time step
- van Rijn uses a different eta_o and u_max for calculating the water level and velocity at the mouth and at location x
- HOWEVER, using original method with u=0.824 and explicit values for omega, m, co, k, mu, and phi from pg. 40 gives accurate Fig. 4.5

## Next steps
- Decipher spreadsheet model
	- Figure out how to get initial velocity since it seems all the calculations stem from this initial guess
