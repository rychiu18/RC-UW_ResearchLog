## Summary
1) Trying to reproduce spreadsheet model from van Rijn

## Results
- van Rijn sent over spreadsheet model
- Things that were different:
	- Calculations for Chezy's and hydraulic radius
		- In van Rijn (2011), C=65 for ks=0.03
		- Using spreadsheet model equations, C=64.83 for ks=0.03 
	- Included river discharge (but set to 0)
- Biggest difference was using the initial peak velocity:
	- "Remember, the model is linearized. Basically, the roughness depends on the velocity. So, you have to iterate (trial and error) manually a few times by making an input velocity equal to the computed velocity."
	- Set U_max (characteristic peak velocity) to 0.67 to calculate friction and other terms
	- Calculated peak velocity that is then used to calculate along channel velocity for each time step
- Tidal amplitude is also calculated first, then used to calculate along channel water level for each time step

Steps I've gathered from the spreadsheet:
1) Calculate beta
2) Calculate omega
3) Calculate hydraulic radius (R)
4) Calculate Chezy's (C)
5) Calculate linearized friction coefficient (m)
6) Calculate classical wave speed (co)
7) Calculate alpha and wavenumber (k) based on "amplified" or "dampened" regime
8) Calculate friction coefficient (mu)
9) Calculate wave speed (c)
10) Calculate phase speed (phi)
11) Calculate width (b)

Next are the new steps:<br>
12) Calculate tidal amplitude (along channel)
13) Calculate peak velocity (along channel)
14) Calculate water level at each time step based on location
15) Calculate velocity at each time step based on location (using peak velocity calculated, but unsure how he got 0.824)

## Issues
- Close to reproducing but unsure about finding peak velocity at each time step
- van Rijn uses a different eta_o and u_max for calculating the water level and velocity at the mouth and at location x
- HOWEVER, using original method with u=0.824 and explicit values for omega, m, co, k, mu, and phi from pg. 40 gives accurate Fig. 4.5

## Next steps
- Decipher spreadsheet model
	- Figure out how to get initial velocity since it seems all the calculations stem from this initial guess
