## Summary
1) Trying to reproduce spreadsheet model from van Rijn

## Results
- van Rijn sent over spreadsheet model
- Things that were different:
	- Calculations for Chezy's and hydraulic radius
	- Included river discharge (but set to 0)
- Biggest difference was using the initial peak velocity:
	- "Remember, the model is linearized. Basically, the roughness depends on the velocity. So, you have to iterate (trial and error) manually a few times by making an input velocity equal to the computed velocity."
	- Set U_max (characteristic peak velocity) to 0.67 to calculate friction and other terms
	- Calculated peak velocity that is then used to calculate along channel velocity for each time step
- Tidal amplitude is also calculated first, then used to calculate along channel water level for each time step

## Issues
- Close to reproducing but unsure about finding peak velocity at each time step

## Next steps
- Decipher spreadsheet model
	- Figure out how to get initial velocity since it seems all the calculations stem from this initial guess
