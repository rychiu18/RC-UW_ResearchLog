# March 03 - March 23, 2024
- Looked up datum references for USGS/NOAA gauges (Westport, Montesano, Tokepoint)
	- All are referenced to NAVD88
		- https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/waterlevels.html?id=9440910 (Toke Point)
		- https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/waterlevels.html?id=9441102 (Westport)
		- https://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/12035100/#parameterCode=00065&period=P7D&showMedian=false (Montesano)
			- https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/inventory?site_no=12035100&agency_cd=USGS (Montesano)
- Bathymetry in "*tw_60m" file in DFM shows -5m constant bathymetry upstream from Hoquiam
- DFM wave model output:
	- Toke point model output has small water depth difference to observed (-0.04672478723m)
	- Westport and Montesano have large (>1m) ∆SSH difference
		- Ignore Montesano bc of bathymetry overestimation
	- Westport and Toke point have mean ∆SSH ~1.3m difference

To do:
- Run original stantec model to compare results
- Run models incrementally backwards removing certain forcings
- Check difference between MSL/MLW at Westport and Tokepoint
- Start research log and share
