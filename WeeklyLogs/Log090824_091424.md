## Summary: 
1) Ran DFM model with v4 grid (default roughness) but still did not do well<br>
2) Ran DFM model with v2 grid (roughness file) and does better than original v2 grid at Montesano and Tokepoint, but worse at Westport<br>
3) Wrote code for inundation maps<br> 


## To do:
1) Run DFM model with v4 grid (default roughness)<br>
2) Run DFM model with v2 grid (new roughness file)<br>
3) Finish code for inundation maps in MATLAB<br>

## Results:
### 1) DFM model comparisons
- Ran model TMD with v4 grid and performed worse at Montesano, and slightly better at Westport and Tokepoint (Tables 1,2,3)
- Water level signal for v4 grid is still muted and overestimates during compound flooding event at Montesano (Figures 1,2)
- Ran model TMD with v2 grid with roughness file and performed slightly better at Montesano for MAE (Table 1,2,3)
	- Could do much better if included waves?

### 2) Inundation maps

## Next steps:
- Improve inundation map graphics
- Run model with v2 grid and waves?
