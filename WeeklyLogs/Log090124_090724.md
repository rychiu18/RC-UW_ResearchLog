## Summary:
1) DFM model with v1 grid and tides, MET, discharge, and waves did the best at modeling December 2023 storm.<br>

## To do:
1) Run DFM model for T (tides), TM (tides+MET), and TMD (tides+MET+discharge) for v3 grid and compare results with v1 and v2.<br>

## Results
### 1) DFM models
- Ran models T, TM, and TMD with the new v3 grid that includes updated roughness
- v1 grid has performed the best when comparing stats with v2 and v3 grids at Montesano, Westport, and Tokepoint (Table 1, 2, 3)
	- v1 with waves performed the best!
- Models TMD and TMDW performed significantly better than models T and TM (Figures 1, 2, 3)

## Issues:
- Grid v3 is not doing as well as the other versions


## Next steps:
- Make zoomed in plots of along Chehalis River
- Continue analytical model
