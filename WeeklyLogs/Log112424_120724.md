## Summary:
- Recreate plots from Van Rijn's (2010) paper

## Results:
### Amplification and damping in an estuary with exponential width
- Tried to recreate Figure 3.7 in the paper (Fig. 1)
- Did well for amplification regime
- c/co does not work well, but for the Lb in the Scheldt, it mostly agrees

### Comparing water level and velocity at x=50km and x=0m for ks=0.03m (Scheldt)
- Water levels closely align with paper's Figure 4.5 (Fig. 2)
- Velocity still underestimates

### Comparing water level and velocity at x=50km and x=0m for ks=0.03m (Scheldt)
- Along channel water level amplitude align with paper's Figure 4.6 (Fig. 3)
- Velocity is still not correct

### Comparing along channel tidal range for Case 1 and Case 3
- Case 1: Converging width over 60km (width b_o=25,000 m, b_L=60km = 2,000 m), depth h=10 m, k_s=0.05 m
- Case 3: Converging width over 60km (width b_o=25,000 m, b_L=60km = 2,000 m), depth h=5 m, k_s=0.05 m
- Case 1 agrees with paper's Figure B7 (Fig. 4)
- Case 3 does not, does not get down to paper's ~2.5m tidal range

## Issues:
- Something wrong with calculating velocity
- CASE 3 tidal range doesn't match paper's
