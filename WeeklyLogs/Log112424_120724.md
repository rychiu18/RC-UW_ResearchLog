# November 24 - December 07, 2024

## Summary:
- Recreate plots from Van Rijn's (2010) paper

## Results:
### Amplification and damping in an estuary with exponential width
- Tried to recreate Figure 3.7 in the paper (Fig. 1)
- Did well for amplification regime
- c/co does not work well, but for the Lb in the Scheldt, it mostly agrees
