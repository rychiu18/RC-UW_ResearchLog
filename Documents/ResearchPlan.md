# Research Plan
## 1) Modeling compound flooding in Willapa Bay and Grays Harbor
### Questions:
#### a) What components contribute to compound flooding along Willapa River and Chehalis River?
	- Goal: to track the evolution of an atmospheric river event (winds, water level, storm surge, precipitation) and develop a relationship between the stage and dominance of major components of compound flooding observed along the Chehalis and Willapa River.
	- Analytical approach:
		- Create momentum budget for each system and analyze major contributors during storm events
			- Tides: M2 
			- Storm surge: K1, M3
			- Adjustment to wave propagation along estuary in response to bed
		- Create volume budget for determining along channel water level variability throughout the systems
			- Chehalis River: Aberdeen to Porter
	- Numerical approach:
		- Model validation
		- Multiple model runs with different combinations of tides, MET, river discharge, and wave forcing
		- Evolution of storm and along channel water level profile

#### b) How does the convergence length scale/bottom slope influence upstream water levels during storms?
	- Goal: compare rate of convergence and slope between both rivers and investigate the different effects between i) shallow vs deeper channels, ii) high vs low rate of convergence at mouth, and iii) shallow vs steep slope profiles.
	- Grays Harbor routinely dredged compared to natural Willapa Bay
		- Deeper water -> less friction -> higher velocity -> lower surge amplitude

#### c) What is the relationship between river discharge, point of transition between fluvial and oceanic influence, and tidal asymmetry?
	- Goals: investigate the influence of tidal phasing on regulating the along channel transition point where fluvial processes (river discharge) begins to dominate over tidal influence.

## 2) Effects on exchange flow around sharp bends during compound flooding events
	- Goals: to determine the relative importance of each term in the momentum budget affecting water level variability throughout river at areas with sharp bends (South Bend, Aberdeen, Montesano)
	- Need to incorporate salinity and depth?
	- Enhanced friction and mixing affecting stratification, leading to decreased stratification and weaker density driven flows
	- Flooding on outer banks affected by asymmetric cross channel water surface slope

## 3) Using JPL's OPERA project (dynamic surface water extent products) to detect flooding extents in Willapa Bay and Grays Harbor
	- Goals: to utilize the JPL's surface water extent product to predict and validate its accuracy with observations and our model (TBD)
